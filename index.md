Contract-First IDP is a developer platform reference architecture and a corresponding set of [Golden Paths](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/) designed to support a productive developer experience, especially for contract-driven integration scenarios. The [developer platform reference manifest](https://github.com/contract-first-idp/platform-components) takes a GitOps approach for platform automation and the [golden path templates](https://github.com/contract-first-idp/software-templates) are designed to streamline a contract-first development methodology.
